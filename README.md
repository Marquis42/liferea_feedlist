Liferea Feedlist, originally supplied by @Marquis42.

This is a feedlist.opml file for the Liferea program. It contains various
RSS/ATOM feeds for technology and a few non-technology feeds. Feel free to
use this as a starting basis and contribute back any additional feeds you
might think I find useful / interesting.
